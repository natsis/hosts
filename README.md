# hosts

An automated script I use to create hosts list for my linux machines.

- Includes some lists in the configuration.
- Merges lists from different sources.
- Accepts custom url entries.
- **Will try to update the host file.**

I uses `sudo` to update the `/etc/hosts` file without any warning.
*May disrupt the spacetime continuum forever.*

I was inspired from [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) and revised a very very old script I had, for the similar purpose.
Here is my new version.
